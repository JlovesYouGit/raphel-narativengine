    Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages quantum mechanical

    computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can 
    exist in multiple states simultaneously. This enables quantum computers to solve certain 
    problems exponentially faster than classical computers, particularly in cryptography, 
    optimization, and simulation of quantum systems.
