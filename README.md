# Light-ASI Phase 3 API Server

This module provides a fully functional HTTP REST API for the Light-ASI engine. It is built entirely on the Python standard library (`http.server`) and has no external dependencies.

## Features
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Full suite of endpoints for querying, indexing, and monitoring the graph.
- **Auth Middleware**: Bearer token authentication required for most endpoints.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates between `admin`, `developer`, `user`, and `guest`.
- **CORS Support**: Preconfigured with permissive CORS headers.
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Run as an interactive terminal or a background/foreground API server.

## Quickstart

Start the server on port 8000:
```bash
python3 main.py --serve 8000
```
